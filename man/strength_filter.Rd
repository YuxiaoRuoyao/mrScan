\usage{
strength_filter(
  dat,
  dat_type = "local",
  R_matrix = NULL,
  df_info,
  pval_threshold = 5e-08,
  F_threshold = 5,

}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A data frame of combined GWAS summary data after LD pruning.
For local data, the required columns include `SNP` for rsID, `trait_ID.beta` for beta hats,
`trait_ID.se` for standard errors, `trait_ID.p` for pvalues.
For IEU data, it should be output from TwoSampleMR::mv_harmonise_data().}

\item{dat_type}{Either "local" or "IEU". Default  = "local"}

\item{R_matrix}{Pairwise sample overlap matrix among traits. Default = NULL}

\item{df_info}{Dataframe of trait info from previous step}

\item{pval_threshold}{pvalue cutoff for selecting instruments. Default = 5e-8}

\item{F_threshold}{F-statistic cutoff. Default = 5}

\item{effect_size_cutoff}{Standardized effect size threshold. Default = 0.1}

\item{Filter}{Whether perform trait filtering based on F-stats and F_threshold. Default = FALSE}

\item{extra_traits}{trait ID you want to include no matter the instrument strength. Default = "None"}

\item{type_outcome}{It could be either "continuous" or "binary". Default = "continuous"}

\item{prevalence_outcome}{Outcome prevalence. It should be input if the outcome is a binary trait. Default = NULL}

\item{type_exposure}{A vector for the type of exposures. The order should be exactly matched
with exposures. eg. c("continuous","binary","continuous") for the second exposure is a binary trait}

\item{prevalence_exposure}{A vector for prevalence of exposures. The order should
be exactly matched with exposures. For continuous trait, just write NA. eg. c(NA, 0.1, NA)}

\item{ss.exposure}{A vector of sample size for exposures. You can provide it when dat_type = "IEU".
The order of it should be the same with beta hat matrix and se matrix. Default = NULL}

\item{df_af}{Outcome from TwoSampleMR::extract_outcome_data, and it contains `eaf.outcome`.
This needs to be input when using local outcome data. Default = NULL}
}
\value{
A list of selected traits, a dataframe of conditional instrument strength and a dataframe of trait info
